### Reflections
*Wins*
1. Usage of useContext to persist state data
2. Setting up error handling on props to reduce debugging
3. Pagination on fruit logs page

*Challenges*
1. State management in App was difficult to modularize to components
2. Implementing responsive design for different screen sizes
